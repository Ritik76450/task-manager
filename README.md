# Task Bliss - A Simple Task Manager


## 1. Application and Functionality
Task Bliss is a minimalist Task Manager built using React and TypeScript. It helps you organize your daily tasks with an easy-to-use interface and a clean design. The core functionalities of the application include:

- Add New Tasks: Quickly add tasks using the input field. Press Enter to add the task or click the Add Task button.
- Mark Tasks as Completed: Toggle tasks as completed to track your progress effectively.
- Delete Tasks: Easily remove tasks you no longer need with a single click.
- Task Persistence: Your tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they remain even if you close or refresh the page.
- Empty State Message: When there are no tasks, a simple message is displayed to prompt you to add a new task.
